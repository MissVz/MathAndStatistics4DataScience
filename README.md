# DS623 Mathematics and Statistics for Data Science
City University of Seattle 2025  
Student: Verónica Elze  
Course Grade: 4.0 (98.66 %)
### Course Description
This course is designed to provide mathematics concepts and applied statistics useful for data science with a statistical programming language. The fundamental mathematical tools needed
to understand machine learning include linear algebra, analytic geometry, matrix decompositions, vector calculus, optimization, probability, and statistics. Topics of applied
statistics range from syntax basics of the chosen statistical programming language, descriptive statistics, and data visualizations to inferential statistics and regressions. Students completing
this course will have an understanding of building intuition and practical experience with applying mathematical and statistical concepts to data science.
### Course Outcomes
As a result of this course, students will know or be able to do the following:
- Understand fundamental mathematical concepts used in data science.
- Apply machine learning algorithms to real-world models using a programming language.
- Analyze machine learning models and algorithms using mathematical and statistical concepts.
